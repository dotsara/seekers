# Interacting with your job candidates

## General

However you choose to do it--a shared, but not public gist; a shared Google doc; a system of your company's own--you should be sharing notes about candidates. I don't mean evaluation notes, I mean basic information.   
* where to find the candidate's résumé
* what position the candidate is up for and who that position's hiring manager & team are
* who they've already spoken to (i.e. a timeline)
* _how they pronounce their names_, how they prefer to be addressed (e.g. Liz not Elizabeth, preferred pronouns ([more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns)), etc.)
* their contact information
* if interview dates are available, then those as well
