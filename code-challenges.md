Code challenges
====


* When is the ideal time to deliver a code challenge to a candidate?
* Are there exceptions for having every candidate complete a code challenge? What are those?   
 * i.e. do they have a deep or currently active GitHub profile that provides you with enough information about how they write code?
* Do you _pay_ candidates for the time they spend on code challenges (whether that's a flat rate or otherwise)? Why or why not?

**Messaging around/about code challenges**   
* Do candidates have the opportunity to review the code challenge and ask questions? That is: do you offer an explicit invitation for questions and not just "let me know if you have any questions"?
* Are you clear about your expectations? Must the code be complete? If not, do you want or expect to see notes/though process? 
* How do you want the challenge delivered back to you? As a (private) GitHub repo? A `.zip` file? Both?
