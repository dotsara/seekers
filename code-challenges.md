Code challenges
====

* When is the ideal time to deliver a code challenge to a candidate?
* Are there exceptions for having every candidate complete a code challenge? What are those?   
 * i.e. do they have a deep or currently active GitHub profile that provides you with enough information about how they write code?
* Do you _pay_ candidates for the time they spend on code challenges (whether that's a flat rate or otherwise)? Why or why not?
