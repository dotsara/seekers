# Questions to ask interviewers

In nearly every (tech) interview, whether an initial call or later rounds, the interviewee has the opportunity to ask their interviewers questions.

**Sara:** I try to have 2-3 questions to ask each interviewer or set of interviewers, _different_ sets of questions in the case of the all-day, multi-session interviews so common in the tech industry. Sometimes having 1 (one) important-to-me question that I ask _each_ group can provide a little insight as each set/interviewer is likely to answers slightly differently.

## categories of questions:

### internal culture

Whether you, as the interviewee define what you mean by culture or ask how it's defined at the potential employer is up to you. It can be illustrative to not define it yourself and let the interviewers demonstrate it.

**Example questions**   
* Is the internal (engineering/company) culture here explicit? Or has it evolved "on its own"?
* What, if any, cultural work does engineering leadership do or expect? Is culture work encouraged or expected of individual devs?

### diversity & inclusion

I (Sara) have also found it educational to use the words "diversity" and "inclusion" and let the interviewers (whether a recruiter in an initial call or otherwise) show me how they think about and define them.

In July 2016, I learned [a useful bit of shorthand for explaining diversity & inclusion](https://twitter.com/dotsara/status/756529441166151680) from @nmsanchez at [Open Source & Feelings](http://www.osfeels.com) in Seattle.

> “Diversity is coming to your party despite my bad experiences at other parties. Inclusion is being glad I came.” 

**Example questions**   
* Are diversity & inclusion important to your organization? To the company at large? _(Ed: the answers to this won't always be yes!)_
* What tools and/or techniques does your organization employ in order to improve its diversity and inclusion? Do you sponsor and/or _attend_ meetups? Conferences? Workshops? 

### workload

**Example questions**   
* Does the organization (engineering) have an on-call rotation for each of its teams? What does that rotation look like? (e.g. pagerduty)

### management

**Example questions**
* "Tell me about a time you helped a direct report develop their career"
